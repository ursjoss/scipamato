= Secrets Management

This document outlines the secrets management practices for this repository.

== Types of Secrets

We use the following types of secrets in this project:

1. *Repository Secrets*: Stored at the repository level
2. *Environment Secrets*: Specific to deployment environments
3. *Organization Secrets*: Shared across multiple repositories

== Secrets Storage

All secrets are stored securely using GitHub's built-in secrets management system.
They are encrypted at rest and in transit.

== Accessing Secrets

Secrets can be accessed in GitHub Actions workflows using the following syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
----

== Current Secrets

=== Repository related secrets

[cols="1,2,1,2", options="header"]
.Github Secrets
|===
|Secret Name |Description |Type |Used In
|DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | UserName to log on to DockerHub | Repository | github action workflows (check and codeql)
|DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | Token to log on to DockerHub | Repository | github action workflows (check and codeql)
|===

NOTE: Pulling the postgresql docker container from DockerHub requires the username/token secrets.


[cols="3,3,6", options="header"]
.Github Workflows
|===
| Workflow Name | File Name | Description
| Check  | check.yml  | Continous Integration workflow running build, detekt, tests, integration tests
| CodeQL | codeql.yml | Runs CodeQL analysis for Java/Kotlin and Javascript/TypeScript
|===


[cols="3,3,6", options="header"]
.gradle.properties in user folder
|===
| property name | Value | Description
| systemProp.sonar.hostUrl | https://sonarcloud.io | sonar host URL
| systemProp.sonar.organization | ursjoss-github | Organisation configured in Sonar
| systemProp.sonar.token | | Access token to Sonar project
|===

Those gradle properties are only required if static code analyzis is to be pushed into Sonar from the local device.


=== Application Secrets

[cols="3,3,6", options="header"]
.Core application.properties 
|===
| property name | Default Value | Description
| scipamato.pubmed-api-key        |                | required to access the Pubmed API
| sync.source.datasource.username | scipamato      | User name for read-only synchronisation access to source (core) database
| sync.source.datasource.password | scipamato      | Password for read-only synchronisation access to source (core) database
| sync.target.datasource.username | scipamadminpub | User name for read-write synchronisation access to target (public) database
| sync.target.datasource.password | scipamadminpub | Password for read-write synchronisation access to target (public) database
| sync.batch.datasource.username  | scipamadmin    | User name for read-write access to database with spring batch tables (typically core)
| sync.batch.datasource.password  | scipamadmin    | Password for read-write access to database with spring batch tables (typically core)
| spring.flyway.user              | scipamadmin    | User name for read-write access to flyway DB migration tables (core)
| spring.flyway.password          | scipamadmin    | Password for read-write access to flyway DB migration tables (core)
|===

[cols="3,3,6", options="header"]
.Public application.properties 
|===
| property name | Default Value | Description
| scipamato.management-user-name     | admin        | User name for accessing the actuator endpoint
| scipamato.management-user-password | admin        | Password for accessing the actuator endpoint
| spring.datasource.hikari.username  | scipamatopub | User name for (read-only) access to public database
| spring.datasource.hikari.password  | scipamatopub | Password for (read-only) access to public database
|===

IMPORTANT: The default values for above properties can and should be overridden in your own application.properties files.


== Adding New Github Secrets

To add a new Github secret:

1. Navigate to the repository settings
2. Click on "Secrets and variables" under the "Security" section
3. Select "Actions" (for workflow secrets)
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Provide a name and value for the secret

== Secret Naming Convention

* Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for secret names

== Secret Rotation

No generic instructions available.


== Best Practices

1. *Least Privilege*: Only grant access to secrets on a need-to-know basis.
2. *Regular Rotation*: Rotate secrets periodically to minimize the impact of potential breaches.
3. *Avoid Hardcoding*: Never hardcode secrets in the codebase or commit them to version control.
4. *Audit Usage*: Regularly review where and how secrets are being used in workflows.
5. *Use Environment Secrets*: For sensitive production credentials, use environment secrets with required reviewers.

== Security Considerations

* Do not log or display secrets in workflow outputs
* Be cautious when using secrets in pull request workflows from forked repositories
* Consider using OIDC with cloud providers for enhanced security
