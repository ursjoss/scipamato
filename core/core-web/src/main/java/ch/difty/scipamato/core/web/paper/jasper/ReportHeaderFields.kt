/**
 * Context holder for localized jasper report captions. Uses builder pattern in
 * order to avoid having constructor with numerous String arguments.
 *
 * This class can be used to serve various jasper reports with different needs
 * for localized labels. Consequently, hardly any validation occurs in this
 * class. It is up to the DTOs that are passed into the reports to validate the
 * required labels are non-null.
